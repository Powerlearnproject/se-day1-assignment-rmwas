Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is the process of Designing, developing, testing and manintaining software systems in a cost effective and highly efficient manner, one where users can use the product with ease.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Introduction to structured programming, this led to introductionof concepts like loops, conditionals which enabled the code to become more understandable.
2. Object Oriented Programming, led to concepts like classes, inheritance, polymorphism
3. Agile methodology, emphasized on flexibility and ability to respond quickly to changing environments.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning, where the team figures out what the project is all about, set goals and arrange on how to achieve them.
2. Requirement analysis, involves finding out what the user requires from the software.
3. Design, deals with the appearance of the software, basically its user interface and the data flow.
4. Implementation, coding the software, turning the design into a functioning software.
5. Testing, used to find and fix any bugs present.
6. Deployment, where software is released to users
7. Maintenence, where updates and fixes are made to improve the software and address any new issues.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall Methodology - Each phase is completed before the next one begins, little chance to overlap, changes difficult to implement once phase is complete. It would be ideal when creating large systems i.e. hospital management system.
Agile Methodology - the project is broken down into small cycles, there's usually overlaps and changes that occur in each cycle.It would be ideal in creating mobile apps where constant changes and updates are required.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer is the individual who writes and maintains code, ensuring the software functions as intended.
Quality Assurance Engineer is the individual that ensures the software meets standard by testing its performance.
Project Manager is the individual who oversees the entire project, to ensure it stays on track

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs make the coding process easier by providing tools that assist in writing, debugging and testing code in one place. VCS ensure that the code development 
is safe and collaborative. An example of an IDE is Visual Studio Code, an example of a Version Control system is git.
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements, i.e. constant updates or addition of new features. Best countered by using Agile methodology because it is flexible and one can make changes easily.
Tight deadlines,i.e. short timespans for finishing a project. Better countered by using realistic timelines depending on the complexity of one's project.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing - testing individual pieces of code, and each piece is tested separately. Helps in detecting bugs early and also improves code quality.
Integration testing - helps see if different parts of codes work in sync, and work together correctly. This ensures proper interaction where various parts of the application work together, and catches any issues on the interface.
System testing - entire application is tested as a whole. It ensures the software performs all functions as intended. Detects issues related to the system's environment.
Acceptance testing - Performed to determine whether software meets end user needs.
Helps in confirming user requirements.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of designing and writing clear and concise instructions to a generative model in order to give a user the results he/she wants.It improves the quality of the response given when using it

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Tell me about Avengers. This prompt is vague since I haven't specified what Avengers is, what is it exactly I want to be told about. An improved prompt will be "Could you give me information about the film Avengers:Age of ultron, such as the cast, and which year it was released, and its box office value"
